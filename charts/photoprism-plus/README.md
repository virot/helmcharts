## Introduction

This chart provides an easy way to run [PhotoPrism® Plus](https://www.photoprism.app/editions#compare) on a home lab or small business Kubernetes cluster while maintaining an approachable configuration.

## Highlights

- Runs the official `photoprism/photoprism` image with non-root defaults (UID/GID 1000).
- Ships with SQLite out of the box; switch to MariaDB/MySQL by filling in the database section.
- Creates lightweight PVCs for `/photoprism/storage` (5 GiB) and, optionally, `/photoprism/originals` (10 GiB) – the cluster’s default storage class is used unless you override it.
- Surfaces the most relevant customization settings (locale, themes, login footer, CORS/CDN, backup schedule) directly in Rancher’s UI or via `values.yaml`.

## Quick Start

```bash
helm repo add photoprism https://charts.photoprism.app/photoprism
helm repo update photoprism
helm upgrade --install photos photoprism/photoprism-plus \
  --namespace photos --create-namespace
```

This deploys PhotoPrism with SQLite storage. To use MariaDB (recommended for larger libraries):

```bash
helm upgrade --install photos photoprism/photoprism-plus \
  --namespace photos \
  --set database.driver=mysql \
  --set database.server=mariadb.default.svc.cluster.local:3306 \
  --set database.name=photoprism \
  --set database.user=photoprism \
  --set database.password=changeme
```

## Storage & Backups

- `persistence.storage` is always created and holds the application state.
- `persistence.originals` can be disabled or redirected to an NFS export when you manage originals elsewhere.
- Backup options (`PHOTOPRISM_BACKUP_*`) are exposed so you can point scheduled backups to another path or tweak retention.

## Customization

Key values you might want to adjust:

- `config.PHOTOPRISM_SITE_TITLE`, `config.PHOTOPRISM_APP_NAME`, `config.PHOTOPRISM_DEFAULT_THEME`
- `config.PHOTOPRISM_AUTH_MODE`, `config.PHOTOPRISM_LOGIN_INFO`, `config.PHOTOPRISM_PASSWORD_LENGTH`
- `config.PHOTOPRISM_CDN_URL`, `config.PHOTOPRISM_CORS_ORIGIN`
- `config.PHOTOPRISM_FILES_QUOTA`, `config.PHOTOPRISM_UPLOAD_LIMIT`

See [`values.yaml`](values.yaml) for the full list.

## Networking and TLS

The chart exposes PhotoPrism on TCP 2342 through a ClusterIP service. You can override the service type or enable an Ingress resource when you terminate TLS  in the cluster edge:

```yaml
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 2342

ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: traefik
  hosts:
    - host: photos.example.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - photos.example.com
      secretName: photos-tls
```

Because TLS typically terminates at the ingress or proxy layer, the chart keeps `PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_TLS` set to `true`. Only enable PhotoPrism’s internal TLS if your cluster design requires end-to-end encryption and you manage the certificates yourself.

## Security Tips

- When `adminPassword` is left blank, a random password is generated and stored in `secret/<release>-photoprism-secrets`.
- Prefer MariaDB/MySQL for multi-user setups or large libraries, and back up both the database and storage PVCs regularly.
- If you expose PhotoPrism on the public internet, pair it with HTTPS termination (Ingress/TLS or an external proxy) and keep the container image up to date.
